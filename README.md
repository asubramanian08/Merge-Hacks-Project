# Save the Food

## Our Project
The pandemic has put a financial strain on many people across the globe so we wanted to create a project those would help those in need. We found that over 820 million people are starving across the world even though one third of all food produced is wasted. This is when we got this idea for **Save the Food**.

**Save the Food** is a website that allows you to track all the food you have and donate the leftovers. Our goal here is to help those in need while also reducing food wastage.
